Education Management System
Overview
This project is an education management platform that allows administrators, teachers, and students to interact with the system efficiently. The system facilitates course management, user enrollment, and grade tracking, with a focus on role-based access control to ensure each user has access to only the features they need.

Key Features

Course Management: Administrators and teachers can create, update, and manage courses, ensuring a dynamic learning environment.

Enrollments and Grade Assignments: Students can enroll in courses, and teachers can assign grades to students for their performance.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Different user roles (Admin, Teacher, Student) are provided with specific permissions to ensure proper access management.

Database Integration: Uses MongoDB as the backend database to store and manage all the information related to users, courses, enrollments, and grades.
